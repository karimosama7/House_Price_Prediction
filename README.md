House Price Prediction Project
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices. Developed under the guidance of AI Coding Academy, this project involved data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation to address real-world housing market challenges.

Project Highlights
1. Data Exploration & Feature Analysis
Data Analysis: Uncovered patterns and trends in housing data.
Visualization: Examined relationships between features like location, size, and year built.
2. Data Preprocessing & Preparation
Encoding: Converted categorical variables to numerical formats using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
Missing Data Handling: Imputed missing values to maintain dataset integrity.
Data Splitting: Divided data into training and testing subsets for accurate model evaluation.
3. Model Development & Implementation
Multiple Linear Regression: Baseline model for understanding feature relationships.
Lasso & Ridge Regression: Applied regularization to balance complexity and accuracy.
Support Vector Regression (SVR): Captured non-linear relationships for improved predictions.
Random Forest Regressor: Used ensemble methods for robust predictions.
Decision Tree Regressor: Implemented for interpretability and efficiency.
4. Model Evaluation & Optimization
Performance Metrics: Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and Cross-Validation scores.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned parameters to enhance accuracy and generalization.
5. Key Insights & Learnings
Gained insights into factors influencing house prices.
Developed expertise in regression modeling, data preprocessing, and feature engineering.
6. Real-World Impact
Provided a data-driven approach for estimating property values, useful for real estate valuation.
